# Data Science Projects Repository
Welcome to the data science portfolio! This repository contains all the notebooks and code for my data science projects. Some projects were part of my studies and some were for trying out and having fun.

## Repository Structure
I will try to keep each notebook as a self-contained unit that contains all the necessary explanations and necessary packages for repeating the experiment. It will not be possible in all cases to create test data, in order to reproduce the experiment completely.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/lumpsoid/data-science-project.git
cd data-science-project
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
Next, open the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks folder to start exploring the data and building models.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:
- conda
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
Required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt. 
These can be installed using 
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
